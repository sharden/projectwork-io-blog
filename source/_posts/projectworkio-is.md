So let's explain what [ProjectWork.io](https://salty-beach-99808.herokuapp.com/) is all about.  SPOILER ALERT! ProjectWork.io is about technology project work. *Its about finding, connecting, and organizing resources to complete technology projects.* Instead of listing a bunch of features that may or may not make the initial web app release, we decided to give you some details on the vision.

## The People Factor

ProjectWork.io focuses on connecting 3 primary users in the technology project space.

1. **Idea** Person
The Idea person is the visionary for the product. The vision could come from the users imagination or a set of requirements that need to be met.

2. **Skill** Person
The Skill person is the talented Developer, UI/UX Designer, Project Manager, or whatever skill set is needed to deliver a technology product.

3. **Resource** Person
The Resource person is the X factor individual with capital resources or human resources(influence) needed to help move a project alone. Venture Capitalist  and Organizations would likely fall in this category.


## The Connection Element
Building strong connections between the users of ProjectWork.io is a no brainer in respect to getting things done. There are 3 elements we'll use as a guide to make sure that happens.


1. **Communication**
Effective communication between users encourages action. Whether it be direct messaging, a chat system powered by [Slack](https://slack.com/is), or the ability to share calendar schedules, effective communication is a must.

2. **Trust**
Trust is important any time you are working on a project and building a team. As a team leader or product owner, you want to know the people you work with are actually who they claim to be. By that I mean, can we trust you to deliver in your skill set? Can we trust you to stay engaged? Can we trust you to keep details confidential where applicable?  

3. **Benefit**
Project work should always come with some mutual benefit, either monetary or the intangible feeling of accomplishment and added experience (which in tech can equate to real dollars).  Everyone thats part of the project or team should feel as if they have gained something during or after the project has completed.

## The Success Factor
We know over time, our users will share what they feel makes ProjectWork.io a success. BUT we do have a few thoughts on what we think would make project work in general successful.  We'll strive to make sure these items become part of the app in some way.

* Well thought out idea/vision
* Communication of idea/vision
* User and Industry research
* Awareness of proper resources
* Access to proper resources
* Consistent team engagement
* Organization and structure
* Action Action Action
